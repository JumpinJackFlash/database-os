# I'm leveraging AsterionDB to build a Virtual Machine architecture with all of the resources, command and control resident within the DB. Some say I shouldn't do it this way but I can't help myself. I'm doing something nobody else has done. Gotta find out what's behind the curtain.

I'm doing this in the open but you probably will not be able to take what I've posted and run with it at this point in time. If you're really interested, reach out and I can help you get going but things are too fluid at this time for me to document the process to install and use the AsterionDB DBOS extension.
